# ReflowMaster

Reflow Master is my open source toaster oven reflow controller that I also sell full assembled on tindie:

It's custom hardware and custom code but all open source so if you want the challenge of making one yourself or you want to hack the code, go for it!

I have a live stream build of the board here if you want to see what's involved

# SAMD21 Bootloader
You will need to use a SAMD21G18 that already has an Arduino bootloader on it *before* it is put on the board. If you need to add a bootloader, you'll need an ATMEL ICE and an adapter for the chip. The cheapest adapter you can get is my SAMD21G Mangler available here...

# Hacking the code
The Reflow Master board works like an "Adafruit Feather M0" - so you'll need to have the Adafruit Cortex m0 hardware profiles installed as well as the regular Cortex m0 Arduino profiles.

You can use the instructions here to install everything you need to get up and running in the Arduino IDE:
https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-m0-basic-proto/setup

You will also need the following lobraries installed
- Spline library http://github.com/kerinin/arduino-splines
- MAX31855 library by Rob Tillaart https://github.com/RobTillaart/Arduino/tree/master/libraries/MAX31855

Plus the following libraries from Library Manager
- One Button
- Adafruit_GFX
- Adafruit_ILI9341
- FlashStorage
   
Enjoy!

I love making and designing projects but sharing open source projects takes a lot of thought and time. I do it because I think itâ€™s important to share knowledge and give back to the community like many have done before me.

If you find this project useful or want to see more open source projects like it, please consider buying me a coffee or backing me on Patreon to say thanks!
